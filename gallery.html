The letters of his initials are not only bold (with the notable exclusion of the interior of the letter “P”), but also skewed to construct a 3-dimensional prism. The colors are kept to cool, earthy tones at at the request of the client, and the font was chosen for its bold blockiness to accompany the structured-ness of the logo art." data-img="./images/g2.JPG" data-other="https://athenakuang.carbonmade.com/projects/7083569">more details</h6>

                <h6 data-p = "
                This poster is designed for an up and coming R&B artist named Summer Walker. If I had to describe Summer Walker’s songs the adjectives would be soft, gentle, loving, longing, romantic—a feeling of inward deepness opening inside you through the bass and jazziness of R&B. The image I’m going for with this poster is a window of an experience: you live in a world with a limited palette of soft pinks. You’re standing on the roof of a building with the deepest longing in the world for someone you love, and you look over the horizon and the sunrise, and your thoughts are practically painted on the sky.
                From the very first iteration (image 2) I knew I wanted to incorporate some sort of abstract skyline, so I pulled together elements (shapes, lines, and a wall texture) to create a graphic of a building with the name of the artist splayed across the lines of a building. However, the building on its own wasn’t enough for me. Over the next few days, I found a model and did a quick 30 minute silhouette photoshoot near a floor-to-ceiling window, and was able to use elements from my photography to craft a room with a shift in perspective and the soft pink skyline seen through a window. Another outside element that I edited for hue and perspective was a skyline photo by Annie Spratt, found on unsplash.com." data-img="./images/g8.JPG" data-other="https://athenakuang.carbonmade.com/projects/7121365">More details</h6>

    <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
